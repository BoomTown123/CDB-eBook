## Human-AI Collaboration

Studies on how humans and AI work together effectively -- and when collaboration fails. Central to Chapter 2 (The AI-First Mindset) and the [Human-AI Collaboration](../frameworks/human-ai-collaboration.md) framework.

| Study | Organization | Key Finding | Topic |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Systematic review of human-AI teaming outcomes | MIT Center for Collective Intelligence | Reviewed 100+ studies and found that human-AI combinations don't, on average, outperform the best human-only or AI-only systems. Collaboration succeeds under three specific conditions. | Human-AI collaboration effectiveness |
| Human-AI teaming study | Nature Human Behaviour | Identified conditions where human-AI teams succeed: tasks where humans outperform AI alone, content creation tasks, and creation tasks specifically involving generative AI. | Conditions for effective collaboration |
| COHUMAIN framework | Carnegie Mellon University | Proposed viewing AI as a "partner under direction" rather than a teammate -- capable of strengthening capabilities but not replacing human judgment. | AI collaboration design |
| AI coding productivity study | METR (Model Evaluation and Threat Research) | Randomized controlled trial found developers were 19% slower with AI assistance but predicted they'd be 24% faster -- a 43-point perception gap. | Developer productivity measurement |

## AI Adoption & Business Impact

Large-scale surveys and analyses on AI adoption patterns across industries. Referenced throughout the book, particularly in chapters on strategy, operations, and teams.

| Study | Organization | Key Finding | Topic |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Global Survey on AI | McKinsey & Company | 88% of companies fail with AI implementation. | AI implementation failure rates |
| AI adoption studies | MIT Sloan | Identified the Buy, Boost, or Build framework for AI capability development. BCG deployed AI to consultants and reduced interview processing from two weeks to 2-3 days. | AI adoption strategies |
| AI productivity research | Accenture | Trained all 700,000 employees in agentic AI. Marketing department saw 25% external brand value improvement and nearly one-third reduction in manual tasks. | Enterprise AI training at scale |
| Enterprise AI spending survey | Multiple sources (industry surveys) | Average monthly AI spend jumped from $62,964 in 2024 to $85,521 in 2025. Companies spending over $100K monthly increased from 20% to 45%. | AI cost trends |
| AI pilot failure analysis | MIT (NANDA study) | 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail to reach production with measurable value. The root cause is infrastructure and process failures, not model quality. | Pilot-to-production gap |
| AI skills and productivity | AWS | AI skills boost productivity by at least 39% across organizations surveyed. | Workforce productivity |
| Enterprise AI tool survey | Zapier | Only 35% of enterprise AI tools go through proper approval channels. 28% of enterprises use more than 10 different AI apps. 76% experienced negative outcomes from disconnected AI. | AI tool sprawl |

## AI Risk & Safety

Research on AI risks, security vulnerabilities, and safety frameworks. Core to Chapter 11 (Ethics, Governance, and Risk) and the [7 AI Risks and Mitigations](../frameworks/7-ai-risks-and-mitigations.md) framework.

| Study | Organization | Key Finding | Topic |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) | NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) | Four-function framework -- Govern, Map, Measure, Manage -- for identifying, assessing, and mitigating AI risks systematically. | AI risk management |
| DeepSeek security evaluation | Cisco | Found a 100% attack success rate against DeepSeek-R1 -- the model failed to block any harmful prompts. Generates insecure code at four times the rate of competitors. | AI model security |
| AI-generated code security | Multiple research groups | Only 55% of AI-generated code is secure. XSS vulnerabilities appear 86% of the time. SQL injection in 20% of cases. | Code security |
| AI incident tracking | Industry tracking | AI incidents jumped 21% from 2024 to 2025 as companies expanded autonomy without expanding controls. | AI incident trends |
| Model degradation study | ML research | 91% of ML models experience performance degradation without intervention due to data drift and concept drift. | Model maintenance |
| AI hiring discrimination study | Research (2024) | AI screening favored white applicants over Black applicants with identical credentials 85% of the time. | Algorithmic bias |
| Secrets leakage report | Industry report (2024) | 23.77 million secrets were leaked through AI systems -- a 25% increase from the prior year. | Data security |

## Data Strategy & Competitive Advantage

Research on data flywheels, data moats, and AI economics. Referenced in Chapter 9 (Data Strategy) and the [Data Flywheel](../frameworks/data-flywheel.md) and [Data Moats](../frameworks/data-moats.md) frameworks.

| Study | Organization | Key Finding | Topic |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Model collapse study | Nature | Models trained on AI-generated content exhibit "narrower range of output over time" -- each generation drifts further from reality. | Synthetic data risks |
| AI startup failure analysis | Industry research | AI startups face a 92% failure rate within 18 months. 42% of companies abandoned most AI initiatives in 2025. | AI startup survival |
| Data accuracy trends | Industry survey | Data accuracy in the U.S. declined from 63.5% in 2021 to just 26.6% in 2024. | Data quality |
| AI wrapper economics | Industry analysis | Average AI wrapper operates at 25-60% gross margins versus 70-90% for traditional SaaS. 60-70% of AI wrappers generate zero revenue. | AI business economics |
| AI customer service effectiveness | Qualtrics (2025) | AI-powered customer service fails at four times the rate of other AI tasks. Nearly one in five consumers see no benefits from AI customer service. | Customer experience |
