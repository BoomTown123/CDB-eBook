# Guides

> Step-by-step practical guides from *Blueprint for an AI-First Company*. Each guide walks you through a specific implementation task, from prerequisites through completion. Use them when you are ready to build, not just plan.

## All Guides

| Guide | Description | Difficulty |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| [Building Your First Agent](building-your-first-agent.md) | End-to-end walkthrough for designing, building, and deploying your first AI agent using the Agent Hub pattern | Advanced |
| [Setting Up an AI Tool Gateway](setting-up-ai-tool-gateway.md) | Guide to implementing the AI Tool Gateway pattern for centralized model access, routing, and cost management | Intermediate |
| [Implementing Data Flywheels](implementing-data-flywheels.md) | How to design and build self-reinforcing data loops that compound your AI product's advantage over time | Intermediate |
| [Polyglot Persistence Setup](polyglot-persistence-setup.md) | Setting up a multi-database architecture that matches the right database to the right workload --- starting simple and adding complexity only when measured problems demand it | Intermediate |
| [AI Coding Workflow](ai-coding-workflow.md) | The eight patterns for working with AI coding tools effectively, with practical examples and a session workflow | Beginner |
| [Team AI Fluency Rollout](team-ai-fluency-rollout.md) | Rolling out AI fluency training across your organization using the 90-Day Program --- covering buy-in, execution, measurement, and scaling | Intermediate |

## How to Use These Guides

Each guide follows a consistent structure:

- **What you'll build/learn** --- The concrete outcome you will have after completing the guide
- **Prerequisites** --- What you need before starting
- **Numbered steps** --- Sequential instructions you can follow from start to finish
- **Key decisions** --- Decision points where you need to choose a path based on your context
- **Related resources** --- Links to frameworks, checklists, and other guides that connect to this topic

Start with the guide most relevant to your current project. Guides are designed to be completed independently, though related guides are cross-referenced where useful.
