# Workflows

> Repeatable step-by-step workflows from *Blueprint for an AI-First Company*. Each workflow defines a process you can follow for a specific operational task --- with clear phases, decision points, and completion criteria. Use them when you need a structured sequence, not just a checklist.

## All Workflows

| Workflow | When to Use | Time to Complete |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| [AI Coding Session Workflow](ai-coding-session-workflow.md) | Starting an AI-assisted coding session --- from context setup through code review | 1--4 hours per session |
| [Agent Failure Recovery](agent-failure-recovery.md) | Diagnosing and recovering from AI agent failures in production | 30 minutes -- 2 hours per incident |
| [Model Evaluation Workflow](model-evaluation-workflow.md) | Selecting or re-evaluating AI models --- uses business constraints as elimination criteria, not benchmark hype | 2--4 hours initial; 1--2 weeks for testing |
| [90-Day Fluency Implementation](90-day-fluency-implementation.md) | Executing the 90-Day AI Fluency Program week by week --- from pre-launch through post-program scaling | 16 weeks (2 pre-launch + 12 execution + 2 evaluation) |

## How to Use These Workflows

Each workflow follows a consistent structure:

- **When to use** --- The specific situation or trigger that makes this workflow relevant
- **Time to complete** --- Realistic time estimate so you can plan accordingly
- **Phased steps** --- Sequential actions organized into logical phases, with checkboxes where applicable
- **Decision points** --- Moments where you choose a path based on your context
- **Related resources** --- Links to frameworks, checklists, and guides that support the workflow

Workflows differ from guides in scope and repetition. Guides are typically followed once to set something up. Workflows are repeated processes you return to each time the trigger condition occurs.

## By Time Commitment

**Under 1 day**
- [AI Coding Session Workflow](ai-coding-session-workflow.md) --- 1--4 hours per session
- [Agent Failure Recovery](agent-failure-recovery.md) --- 30 minutes -- 2 hours per incident

**Multi-day to multi-week**
- [Model Evaluation Workflow](model-evaluation-workflow.md) --- 2--4 hours initial + 1--2 weeks testing

**Multi-month**
- [90-Day Fluency Implementation](90-day-fluency-implementation.md) --- 16 weeks total
