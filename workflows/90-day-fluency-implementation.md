# Workflow: 90-Day AI Fluency Program Implementation

> A week-by-week implementation workflow for rolling out the 90-Day AI Fluency Program, from pre-launch preparation through post-program scaling.

*Based on the [90-Day AI Fluency Program](../frameworks/11-ninety-day-ai-fluency-program.md) framework --- Chapter 8*

## When to Use This Workflow

- When you have executive sponsorship and are ready to begin the 90-day program
- When scaling from a successful pilot to the next cohort
- When adapting the program for a specific department or function

## Time to Complete

2 weeks pre-launch + 12 weeks execution + 2 weeks evaluation = approximately 16 weeks total.

## Pre-Launch: Weeks -2 to 0

**Week -2:** Provision AI tool licenses. Select 20--50 participants across 3+ functions. Assign ground troops (1 per 15--20 participants). Create a dedicated cohort channel.

**Week -1:** Measure baselines (tool usage, output per person, cycle times, satisfaction). Prepare materials. Brief ground troops. Confirm executive sponsor for kickoff.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1--4)

**Week 1 --- First Win:** 60-minute kickoff. Ensure every participant completes a basic AI task on day one. *Success: 100% complete one task.*

**Week 2 --- Daily Practice:** Low-stakes daily tasks (email drafting, meeting summaries). Ground troops check in with each participant. *Success: 80%+ used AI 3+ times.*

**Week 3 --- Expanding Comfort:** Longer document analysis, brainstorming, information synthesis. Share explicit examples of AI limitations. *Success: Participants articulate what AI is bad at.*

**Week 4 --- Phase Review:** Launch recurring office hours. Executive sponsor hears early wins. Measure adoption rate and confidence. *Success: 90%+ adoption; reported time savings.*

## Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 5--8)

**Week 5 --- Domain Use Cases:** Function-specific tasks (engineering: code review; finance: analysis; marketing: content; customer service: response templates; operations: process docs). *Success: 2+ use cases per participant.*

**Week 6 --- Prompt Libraries:** Each participant saves 5+ working prompts. Teams share within functions, then cross-functionally. *Success: Shared library with 80%+ contributions.*

**Week 7 --- Peer Learning:** Structured show-and-tell (30 min, biweekly). Launch communities of practice. Optional half-day hackathon. *Success: Unprompted tip sharing.*

**Week 8 --- Phase Review:** Measure output changes and cycle time improvements against baselines. Identify future ground troops. Adjust use cases based on what drove adoption. *Success: Measurable improvement in 1+ metric per function.*

## Phase 3: Mastery (Weeks 9--12)

**Week 9 --- Complex Workflows:** Multi-step tasks requiring AI + human judgment. Technical teams start agent pipelines. *Success: Completed multi-step workflow.*

**Week 10 --- Autonomy:** Reduce ground troop intervention. Focus on "when not to use AI." Participants document top 3 use cases with time savings. *Success: Can explain when AI is the wrong tool.*

**Week 11 --- Teaching:** Pair each participant with 2--3 future cohort members. Create short guides of best use cases. *Success: Taught one colleague a specific technique.*

**Week 12 --- Conclusion:** Final measurement against baselines. Executive review with ROI data. Graduate recognition. Confirm ground troops for Cohort 2. *Success: Documented ROI supporting expansion.*

## Post-Program: Weeks 13--14

**Week 13:** Compile program report. Document lessons learned. Collect testimonials.

**Week 14:** Refine materials. Graduates begin Cohort 2 preparation as ground troops, each supporting 15--20 new participants.

## Break-Even Expectations

| Deployment Type | Break-Even | Expected ROI |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Focused single-team | 3--5 months | 300%+ over 3 years |
| Multi-team rollout | 6--9 months | 300%+ over 3 years |
| Enterprise-wide | 9--12 months | 300%+ over 3 years |
