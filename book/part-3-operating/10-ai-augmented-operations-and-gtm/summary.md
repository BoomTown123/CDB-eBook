# Chapter Summary: AI-Augmented Operations and GTM

## Key Takeaways

1. **Hybrid beats full automation:** Resolution rates hit 87% for hybrid human-AI systems versus 74% for AI alone. Customer satisfaction averages 8.7 versus 7.4. Klarna learned this the hard way—rehiring human agents after customer satisfaction cratered. Default to augmentation; automate only as confidence builds.

2. **API-first architecture enables AI access:** Every dashboard a human uses should expose an API that agents can query. The 80/20 design principle—deterministic logic for routine tasks, LLMs for judgment—delivers 3x faster task completion. GraphQL reduces API calls by 75% for AI implementations.

3. **Start internal before going customer-facing:** IT help desk delivers 90% ticket reduction with lowest risk. Customer support gets headlines but higher stakes—visible failures kill momentum. Finance shows 7.5-day month-end close acceleration. Build confidence internally first.

4. **Measure outcomes, not activity:** GitHub Copilot's 39x ROI proves measurement matters—but only 51% of organizations can evaluate AI ROI. Zillow's $500M write-down shows what happens when models run on stale data. Track efficiency, quality, AI performance, and business impact—stopping at efficiency misses degradation until it destroys relationships.

5. **Unified data beats fragmented tools:** Gong's 481% three-year ROI comes from 3 billion conversations feeding models that improve for all customers. HubSpot's 63% adoption drives 92% data quality improvement. 80-88% of AI projects fail from data quality. The architecture matters more than the algorithm.
