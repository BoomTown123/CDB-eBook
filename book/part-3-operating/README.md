# Part III: Operating

Running the AI-first company—teams, data, operations, and growth.

---

## Overview

With infrastructure and architecture in place, the challenge shifts to day-to-day operations. This section covers how to structure teams for AI-first work, build data strategies that compound, and use AI to scale both internal operations and customer-facing growth.
