# Part I: Foundations

Understanding the fundamentals of what makes a company truly AI-first.

---

## Overview

Before diving into tactics, we establish why being AI-first matters, what it actually means, and the landscape of tools and providers you'll need to navigate. This section covers the strategic rationale, the mindset shift required, and the foundational technology decisions that everything else builds upon.

## Chapters in This Part

### [Chapter 1: The AI-First Imperative](./01-the-ai-first-imperative/README.md)
The case for starting AI-first and the competitive advantages it creates. We explore the difference between AI-first and AI-enabled companies, first-mover advantages, and the inverted economics of building with AI.

### [Chapter 2: The AI-First Mindset](./02-the-ai-first-mindset/README.md)
How AI-first founders think differently about opportunities and building. Covers agent-first design, [build vs buy calculus](../../frameworks/build-vs-buy-calculus.md), [data as product](../../frameworks/data-flywheel.md), and [human-AI collaboration](../../frameworks/human-ai-collaboration.md).

### [Chapter 3: The AI Landscape — Models, Providers, and Aggregators](./03-the-ai-landscape/README.md)
Navigating foundation models, providers, and aggregators. A decision framework for choosing between OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, open source, and routing strategies with OpenRouter.
