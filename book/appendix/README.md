# Appendix

This section provides supplementary material to deepen your understanding and support implementation of AI-first principles.

**Extended Examples** offers detailed case studies that expand on concepts from the main chapters—Amazon and Tesla's AI evolution, HubSpot and Gong's go-to-market transformation, and Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI.

**Frameworks and Templates** provides actionable tools: a 90-day AI fluency program for teams and a polyglot persistence implementation guide.

Use these resources as references when applying the book's concepts to your organization.
