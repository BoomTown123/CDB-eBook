# Checklists

> Actionable checklists derived from the frameworks in *Blueprint for an AI-First Company*. Each checklist distills a framework into concrete, checkbox-style action items you can work through before, during, or after an AI initiative. Use them as pre-flight checks, audit tools, or progress trackers.

## How to Use These Checklists

Each checklist follows a consistent structure:

- **Title and purpose** --- what the checklist covers and when to use it
- **Categorized action items** --- checkbox items grouped by theme, using `- [ ]` syntax so you can track progress in any markdown tool
- **Source attribution** --- links back to the frameworks and chapters each checklist is derived from

Start with the checklist most relevant to your current initiative. Items are ordered so that earlier categories inform later ones---work through them sequentially within each checklist.
