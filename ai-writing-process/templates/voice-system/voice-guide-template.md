# Voice Guide Template

Your voice guide is the DNA file -- the non-negotiables that make your writing yours. It feeds directly into the master system prompt and gets referenced in every writing, editing, and review session.

Build this after completing your gold standard reference. The techniques you extracted there become the voice elements here.

**How to Use:**
1. Distill your voice into three core qualities
2. Define 3-5 non-negotiable voice elements (from your gold standard analysis)
3. Calibrate your spectrums (formality, density, authority)
4. Catalog your signature phrases
5. Reference this from the master system prompt

# Author Voice Guide

> Core voice DNA for [YOUR BOOK TITLE] by [YOUR NAME].

## Core Principle

**[YOUR VOICE IN THREE WORDS]**

These three qualities define your writing. When they coexist, the voice is right. When any is missing, the output sounds generic.

1. **[QUALITY 1]** -- [What this means for your writing. One sentence. e.g., "Every paragraph carries weight. No filler, no padding."]
2. **[QUALITY 2]** -- [One sentence. e.g., "Talks TO the reader, not AT them. 'You' not 'one' or 'organizations.'"]
3. **[QUALITY 3]** -- [One sentence. e.g., "Admits uncertainty. Shows personality. Not a consultant's report."]

**The Test:** [YOUR litmus test for voice quality. e.g., "Would I say this to a smart colleague over coffee?"]

## Voice Calibration: Finding the Sweet Spot

Map your voice on each spectrum. The "Sweet Spot" column is your target -- use the other columns to catch drift.

### Formality

| Too Casual | Sweet Spot | Too Formal |
|------------|------------|------------|
| [Your example of too casual] | [Your actual voice] | [Your example of too formal] |
| [Another example] | [Another example] | [Another example] |

### Density

| Too Sparse | Sweet Spot | Too Verbose |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| [Your example] | [Your actual voice] | [Your example] |
| [Another example] | [Another example] | [Another example] |

### Authority

| Too Humble | Sweet Spot | Too Arrogant |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| [Your example] | [Your actual voice] | [Your example] |
| [Another example] | [Another example] | [Another example] |

## The Authenticity Test

Before any section is final:

1. **Would I say this to a peer?** If it sounds like a memo, rewrite.
2. **Is there personality here?** If anyone could've written it, add perspective.
3. **Am I honest about what's hard?** If everything sounds easy, add complexity.
4. **Is there something memorable?** If no phrase sticks, add an analogy.
5. **Does it hit gold standard density?** See your Gold Standard Reference.
