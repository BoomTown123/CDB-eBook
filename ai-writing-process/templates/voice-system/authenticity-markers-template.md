# Authenticity Markers Template

Your authenticity markers file catalogs the specific phrases, patterns, and structures that make writing sound like you -- and the ones that make it sound like generic AI. This is the operational companion to your voice guide: less philosophy, more search-and-replace.

Build this after you've written a few sections with AI assistance. You'll start noticing patterns that feel wrong. Capture them here. The kill list will grow over time -- that's the point.

**How to Use:**
1. Catalog your natural opening, transition, and perspective phrases
2. Build your kill list (phrases to delete on sight)
3. Add AI pattern detection rules as you spot them
4. Define your structural patterns (frameworks, analogies, closings)
5. Reference this file during editing passes

# Authenticity Markers

> Phrases and patterns that sound like YOU, not generic AI.

## The Problem

AI writing tools default to patterns like "It's important to note that..." and "Let's delve into..." These are competent but generic. The goal: writing readers would recognize as yours -- even without your name on it.

## Kill List: Delete on Sight

### Corporate Speak

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Replace With |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| "It's important to note that..." | Announces instead of stating | Just state the point |
| "Let's delve into..." | AI cliche | "Here's how..." or just start |
| "In conclusion..." | Announces the ending | Just end |
| "Organizations should endeavor to..." | Stiff, distancing | "You should..." |
| "[YOUR DISCOVERED PATTERN]" | [Why] | [Your fix] |
| "[YOUR DISCOVERED PATTERN]" | [Why] | [Your fix] |

### Filler Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Replace With |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Throat-clearing intros | Delays the point | Start with the point |
| Decorative adjectives (comprehensive, robust) | Empty calories | Delete or be specific |
| Same point restated three ways | Padding | One statement, move on |
| Meta-commentary ("Why this works:") | Over-explains | Let the example teach itself |
| Hedge stacking ("might potentially perhaps") | No conviction | Take a position |
| "[YOUR DISCOVERED FILLER]" | [Why] | [Your fix] |

## AI Pattern Detection

These are tells that text was AI-generated. Train yourself to spot them.

| Pattern | Why It's AI | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Three examples in every list | Too neat, too symmetrical | Vary list lengths |
| Perfect parallel structure everywhere | Real writing is messier | Allow asymmetry |
| Every point weighted equally | Real emphasis varies | Some points matter more |
| Smooth transitions everywhere | Too polished, too even | Occasional abrupt shifts are human |
| No personal references | Missing practitioner voice | Add "I've seen..." or equivalent |
| "[YOUR DISCOVERED AI TELL]" | [Why it's obvious] | [Fix] |
| "[YOUR DISCOVERED AI TELL]" | [Why] | [Fix] |

---

## Structural Patterns

Your go-to structures for organizing ideas. These are templates AI should default to.

### [PATTERN 1 -- e.g., The Numbered Framework]

```markdown
## [Number] [Noun] for [Outcome]

### 1. [Point Title]
[Explanation]
[Example]
[Action item or implication]

### 2. [Point Title]
[etc.]
```

### [PATTERN 2 -- e.g., The Balanced Take]

```markdown
## [Provocative Question]

### The Case For [View A]
[Points]

### The Case Against [View B]
[Points]

### The Realistic Position
[Your nuanced synthesis]
```

### [PATTERN 3 -- e.g., The Reality Check]

```markdown
What most people think: [Common assumption]

What actually happens: [Reality]

[Land on implication -- no "Why this matters:" header]
```

### [PATTERN 4 -- e.g., The Analogy Bridge]

```markdown
Think of [complex concept] like [familiar reference].

[One sentence showing how it maps]

[Land on action or implication]
```

## Transformations: Before/After

Use these as calibration examples for AI. Show what your voice turns generic into.

### Generic -> Your Voice

**Before:**
"[PASTE A GENERIC VERSION OF SOMETHING YOU'D WRITE ABOUT]"

**After:**
"[PASTE HOW YOU'D ACTUALLY SAY IT]"

### AI-Feel -> Human Voice

**Before:**
"[PASTE AN AI-SOUNDING VERSION]"

**After:**
"[PASTE YOUR REWRITE]"

### Verbose -> Punchy

**Before:**
"[PASTE A WORDY VERSION]"

**After:**
"[PASTE YOUR TIGHTENED VERSION]"

[Same meaning. Half the words. Twice the impact.]
