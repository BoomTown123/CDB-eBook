- A description of what the example demonstrates
- Which chapter or framework it relates to
- The language and dependencies used
- A link to your code or a summary of the implementation

We will work with you to determine the best way to include it.

## Style Guidelines

- Use standard Markdown formatting. Do not use wiki-style links.
- All internal links must be relative paths (e.g., `frameworks/12-data-flywheel.md`, not absolute URLs).
- Keep descriptions concise and actionable.
- Code examples should be minimal, well-commented, and educational. They are meant to illustrate patterns, not serve as production-ready implementations.
- Do not include emojis in file content.
- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Use tables for structured comparisons and bulleted lists for shorter enumerations.
